Please let me know if you find any errors or missing effects!

To fix blurry numbers, change your Reffect font to the largest possible size.
Still thinking of how to implement conditions in a neat manner. There are two optional Condition displays available (disabled by default) if you want to use them. Also, no underwater exclusive stuff for the moment (Whirlpool, for instance), sorry!

# Changelog
**1.6.1**
- Created an additional pack download option with 150% larger Skill icons.
- Moved sigil display into LeftSide and RightSide groups to edit more easily.
- Removed erroneous "CelestialAvatar" inside Thief Profession skills.
- Fixed incorrect naming of groups within "ChronoVirtuoso" group. 

**1.6.0**
- **Important: From this version on, the _"Reuse game icons"_ option must be turned on in Reffect settings!**
## Added skill cooldown tracking
- Two versions: with **Icons** and **Minimalistic**.
- Icons is on and Minimalistic is off by default. The objective of both is to be the least intrusive possible while still providing helpful information and reducing cognitive load.
- Minimalistic version is an experiment and currently only includes Weapon and Slot skills.
- Skills will be darkened while on cooldown. As their recharge nears completion, they will flash yellow to provide additional feedback.
- Auto Attack Chains will slowly flash yellow while in progress. The last attack in the Chain will rapidly flash red. This is to aid in finishing Chains.
- Profession Skills are tentatively arranged, feedback is welcome!
- Skill Icons have the *show stacks* option enabled. If the numbers prove to be too small, there is the possibility of adding larger overlayed numbers in a future update.
- Guardian does **not** have a Profession skill section, as Virtue state is already clearly represented by the existing icons.
- Renegade Profession skill section has an alternative layout available, disabled by default, which places the skills closer to the Energy Bar.
- Engineer/Scrapper Profession skill section has an alternative layout available, disabled by default, which condenses the skills in the same layout as the weapon skills.
- Mesmer Profession skill section has an alternative layout ("Unified"), disabled by default, which keeps Shatters 1 through 4 in the same position for every Specialization, and places Shatter 5 above the Clones bar.
- Special Action Skill has an alternative position that makes it stand out more from the weapon skills.
