# Kaedalus Reffect Megapack
 A Reffect pack with all classes' resources, traits and skills, as well as additional useful general stuff.

All neatly organized so you can easily toggle and move anything you want! Also already filtered so only relevant stuff for your current profession will be displayed. :)
Every image is pulled directly from the Wiki, except for: Firebrand Pages, Thief Initiative, Elementalist Attunements, Mesmer Clones/Blades, Scourge Shades.

Reffect Version of latest update: v0.2.3

Please let me know if you find any errors or missing effects!

Currently the main issue is that icons take quite a while to load when starting up, due to the large amount.
To fix blurry numbers, change your Reffect font to the largest possible size.
Still thinking of how to implement conditions in a neat manner. Also, no underwater exclusive stuff for the moment (Whirlpool, for instance), sorry!
